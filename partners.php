            <strong>Biomass India (BMI)</strong> is the pioneering Indian organisation for biomass up-cycling. We are the go-to partner organisation 
            for state governments and industries who want to eliminate the practice of agricultural residue burning and are willing to invest in 
            waste-to-value ecosystems in their regions. BMI aims to become the leading Indian forum for biomass upcycling. The programme, which 
            started in 2021, provides a unique waste-to-value ecosystem, which intends to deliver on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, 
            and the Paris Climate Agreement goals. It brings together entrepreneurs, investors, innovators, farmers and policymakers in innovative 
            partnerships to use agricultural waste to create products and services of value for the global market.
