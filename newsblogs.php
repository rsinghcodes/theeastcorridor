            <strong>The East Corridor Consultants India</strong> (TECC) is a startup, working on sustainable solutions across various
            platforms. We at The East Corridor Consultants use innovative solutions to make a substantial impact on
            society and planet. TECC believe in ‘3R’ strategy of waste management i.e., reduce, reuse and recycle.
            TECC would be creating a substantial positive impact on the environment by producing range of products all
            with agricultural wastes. TECC is committed to make efforts to reduce garbage from the planet and make
            our life healthier by using innovative solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through <strong>Kalon</strong>, TECC envisions to become world's largest manufacturer and supplier of eco-friendly and
            100% naturally compostable food packaging and tableware products. These products will be stylish, durable, economic and 
            sustainable. We will also create a substantial positive impact on the environment as we will produce them all with a range 
            of agricultural wastes e.g. paddy straw (parali), sugarcane bagasse, banana stem etc. without using any chemicals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not only this, we would be empowering millions of small holder farmers by providing them an alternative source of income 
            from their agricultural wastes thereby improving their livelihood. For this, we are connecting with Farmer Producer Companies 
            (FPCs)and Farmer Cooperatives for procurement and profit sharing, thereby raising their farm incomes. In UP, along with 
            our partner UPPRO we have a wide spread base of 40000 famers and the numbers are increasing steadily. The buck does not 
            stop there we would like to create awareness about regenerative farming. 
          </p>

            This will help to increase biodiversity and soil organic matter, conserve and rehabilitate the soil.
          </p>
          <p>
            In West Bengal, in the district of South 24 Parganas, TECC is working with Sundarban Cooperative Milk & Livestock Producers’ 
            Union Ltd, a women farmers’ cooperative for marketing of their organic products like paddy, honey and milk & byproducts. The
            cooperative has a good network across the district with collection centers for milk and other agri products.
            The products are available through our online platform <strong>Kurmah</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            TECC believes in completing the loop by encouraging farmers and artisans in traditional practices and the products that are 
            being produced by using sustainable raw materials. We not only support sustainable practices for the production of our products 
            but also make a conscious effort to ensure fair prices for our artisans by connecting to the farm gate and thereby ensuring 
            that authentic handlooms, crafts, and organic products reach our customers through Kurmah.
          </p>

            <strong>Manav Vikas Sansthan</strong> works for the better living standards of the farming community. The NGO focuses on providing
            basic sanitation, medical camps and insurance.
          </p>
          <p>
            A mobile app <strong>KrishakPay</strong> will enable FPCs to connect with farmers directly and facilitate both the forward and
            backward linkages. The traceability of the raw material can be mapped by this App and thereby increase transparency in our end 
            products through Blockchain. Thee app will ensure fair trade prices for our farmers.
