      <p>
        The  adverse  effects  of  climate  changes  like  trapping  of  heat  generated  through  harmful  gases  in  the  
        atmosphere, soil erosion, depleting water levels, and diminishing forests are extremely harmful for the existence 
        of humans as well as flora and fauna. The Plastic soup is also accelerating climate breakdown and threatening 
        our  ability  to  maintain  a  survivable  climate.  In  agriculture  sector  as  global  warming  increases,  new  pest  and  
        disease pressures are impacting crop yields and quality. Climate change presents a fundamental threat to our 
        ability to remain viable in the years to come. The world today is in dire need to aggressively embrace sustainable 
        solutions to minimize the harmful effects of climate change.  
      </p>
      <p>
        We are committed to being part of the solution. Let’s Live Sustainably.
