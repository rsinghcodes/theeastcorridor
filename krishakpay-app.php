            The entire process will be monitored by our farmer friendly easy to
            use KrishakPay app. The farmer after registering his details and
            that being verified by the nodal FPC, can book a slot and space to
            deliver its raw material to the nearest collection point. Based on
            the raw material and quantity the farmer will get his payments into
            his bank account. The farmer can get reward points and also earn
            carbon credits for the raw material deposited at the collection
            points.

            The reward points can be used as e- wallet to get benefits from
            various schemes which TECC will run by linkages with other service
            providers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The traceability of the raw material can be mapped by this App and
            the data may be used to ensure fair prices for farmers (FAIRTRADE)
            and also increase transparency in our end products through
            Blockchain.
