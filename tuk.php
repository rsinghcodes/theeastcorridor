              At a time when our interaction with nature is limited to our
              backyards, we take inspiration from the healing qualities and the
              sheer beauty of our nature by introducing TuK - 100% pure
              biodegradable products for women for an intimate and pure feel.
              Given the span of years from menarche (a girlâ€™s first bleed) to
              menopause, ovulatory-menstrual cycle knowledge, and skills which
              go with the phases of the moon are useful over a lifetime.
              Redefining the story by switching to a natural, safer product that
              does not have any harmful chemicals or plastic. A woman's intimate
              care is as important as her personal care. Let's solemnize the
              'green mensuration'.
