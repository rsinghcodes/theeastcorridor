              <strong>Kalon<sup>TM</sup></strong> is an Ancient Greek word and concept. It literally means "beautiful thing", but it connotes far
              more than just physical beauty. Of course, what we create is series of beautiful alternatives to all the conventional packaging
              solutions, by supporting eco-friendly and truly sustainable packaging by upcycling agricultural waste. Hence, Kal√≥n, besides
              hitting on the aspect of physical beauty, also means what is good, useful, and virtuous.

        Through Kalon, TECC envisions to become world's largest manufacturer and supplier of eco-friendly and 100% naturally compostable food packaging
        and tableware products. These products will be stylish, durable, economical and sustainable. We will also create a substantial positive
        impact on the environment as we will produce them all with a range of agricultural wastes e.g. paddy straw (parali), sugarcane bagasse, banana
        stem etc. without using any chemicals.
